VEX FOR VIM
============

Basic SideFX Houdini [VEX Language](http://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/vex/lang.html) support for VIM

## Difference Between Official VFL Syntax

There is an offical vfl syntax file for VIM in `$HFS/houdini/public/syntax` directory -- which is just C definition

If a picture can speak a thousand words:

*// it was after I wrote this syntax file that I found there is an official one, luckily it was not good engough, so my time was not wasted :P*

## How To Install

With [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim): no need to say I think

## How To Use

Inside Houdini: Open variables dialog (Menu -> Edit -> Aliases and Variables -> Variables)

Set variable `EDITOR` to `<YOUR PATH TO GVIM EXECUTABLE>` to use VIM as your VEX editor
